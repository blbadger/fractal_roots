# Polynomial roots

A few programs to find which regions converge on a polynomial root, and which do not.  Evaluate trajectories and generate images for Newton's method, Halley's method, and the secant method in the complex plane.  See 'optimized' for faster methods using numexpr.

As an example, here is a map in C (light pixels take longer to settle on a root than dark) of x^13-x-1 using Halley's method:

and Newton's method for x^7.11-x-1
